    question: "What is prop drilling in react?",
    answer:
      "Prop drilling in React refers to the process of passing down props (properties) from a parent component to a deeply nested child component, even if the intermediate components do not need or use those props. This can lead to a cluttered and less maintainable codebase, as props need to be passed through multiple layers of components, making it harder to understand and modify the code.",
    explanation: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How would you prevent a component from rendering in React?",
    answer:
      "To prevent a component from rendering in React, you can use conditional rendering. You can wrap the component's JSX code inside an if statement or a ternary operator, where you specify a condition. If the condition evaluates to true, the component will render; otherwise, it won't. This allows you to control when and under what circumstances the component should be displayed. By dynamically adjusting the condition, you can easily show or hide the component based on certain logic or user interactions.",

  },
  {
    question: "What do these three dots (...) in React do?",
    answer:
      "The three dots (...) in React, called the spread operator, can be used to make copies of objects or arrays. With objects, it lets you create a new object by copying properties from an existing object and adding or changing specific ones. For arrays, it allows you to create a new array by combining elements from different arrays. The spread operator is handy for manipulating data in React and simplifies tasks like updating component state or merging objects with new properties.",
    explanation: "",
  },
  {
    question: "Why React uses className over class attribute?",
    answer:
      "React uses `className` instead of `class` in HTML because `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript. Using `class` would cause conflicts with JavaScript syntax. So, to avoid issues, React uses `className` for specifying CSS classes on elements. This allows developers to apply CSS classes to React components without running into conflicts or JavaScript errors.",
    explanation: "",
  },
  {
    question: "Why we should not update state directly?",
    answer:
      "Updating the state directly in ReactJS is not recommended because it can cause unexpected issues and make it hard to track changes.

    question: "What's wrong with using Context in React?",
    answer:
      "Context in React is not inherently bad, but it should be used carefully. Using Context extensively can make your code harder to understand and maintain. It may also cause unnecessary re-rendering and may not be the best choice for managing global state in complex applications. So we should consider other state management options like Redux for larger projects.",

    question: "When shall we use useReducer hook in ReactJS?",
    answer:
      "The useReducer hook in ReactJS is typically used when you have complex state logic that involves multiple related values or when the state transitions are more intricate. It is a good choice when you find that managing state with the useState hook becomes cumbersome and leads to complex and nested code.",
    explanation: "",
  },
  {
    question: "How does React renderer work exactly when we call setState?",
    answer:
      "When you use setState in React, it triggers a process called reconciliation. React compares the old and new state, figures out what changed, and updates only the necessary parts of the user interface. It does this by creating a virtual copy of the user interface called the virtual DOM and then efficiently applying the required changes to the actual web page. This helps React make updates quickly and keeps your app running smoothly.",

    question: "What is Intersection types in Typescript?",
    answer:
      'Intersection types allow you to combine multiple types into a single type that has all the properties and methods of each constituent type. It is denoted by the "&" symbol.',
    explanation: "```",
  },
  {
    question: "What is Union types in Typescript?",
    answer:
      'Union types allow you to define a type that can hold values of multiple types. It is denoted by the "|" symbol.',
    explanation: "",
  },
  {
    question: "Which TypeScript types are immutable?",
    answer:
      "In TypeScript, all primitive data types, such as strings, numbers, booleans, etc., are immutable, meaning that the value cannot be changed more than once. Additionally, it means that passing them to functions has no negative impacts.",
    explanation: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is namespace in Typescript?",
    answer:
      "In TypeScript, a namespace is a way to organize and group related code elements such as classes, interfaces, functions, and variables under a single name. Namespaces provide a mechanism to avoid naming conflicts and create a logical hierarchy within your codebase.",
    explanation: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is modules in Typescript?",
    answer:
      "Modules in TypeScript allow you to organize and encapsulate code into separate files. By using the `export` keyword, you can make specific code elements accessible to other modules, while the `import` keyword allows you to use those exported elements in your module. Modules make it easier to manage dependencies, reuse code, and maintain a modular structure in your TypeScript projects.",
    explanation: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is mixins in Typescript?",
    answer:
      "In TypeScript, mixins allow you to extend a class by combining the properties and methods from other classes. They provide a way to reuse code across multiple classes without using inheritance. By applying a mixin to a target class, you can add additional functionality to the class in a modular and flexible manner.",
    explanation: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What is declaration merging in Typescript?",
    answer:
      "Declaration merging in TypeScript lets you combine multiple declarations with the same name into a single declaration. It allows you to add or extend properties, methods, or functionality to existing types, making it easier to build and extend code across multiple sources without duplicating definitions.",
    explanation: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the Disadvantages of TypeScript?",
    answer:
      "TypeScript has a few drawbacks. It requires extra time and effort to annotate types, which can slow down development. It also has a learning curve, especially for developers new to static typing. The compilation step can add complexity to the workflow, and integrating TypeScript with existing JavaScript codebases may require extra work and introduce compatibility challenges.",
    explanation: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What are decorators in TypeScript?",
    answer:
      "Decorators in TypeScript allows us to add metadata or behavior to classes, methods, properties, or parameters at design time. They are declared using the @ symbol followed by the decorator name, placed just before the class, method, property, or parameter declaration.",
    explanation: "",
  },
  {
    question: "Does TypeScript Support All Object Oriented Principles?",
    answer:
      "Yes, Typescript support all object oriented principles. There are 4 main principles to Object Oriented Programming: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism. TypeScript can implement all four of them with its smaller and cleaner syntax",
    explanation: "",
  },
  {
    question: "Does TypeScript supports function overloading?",
    answer:
      "Yes, TypeScript supports function overloading, which means you can define multiple versions of a function with different parameter types or arity. This allows you to provide different implementations of the function based on the arguments passed to it.",
    explanation: "",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the best practices when using TypeScript?",
    answer:
      "To use TypeScript effectively, follow these best practices: use static typing for error prevention and code clarity, enable strict mode and null checks, minimize the use of any type, follow consistent naming conventions, keep TypeScript and compiler options up to date, etc.",
    explanation: "",
